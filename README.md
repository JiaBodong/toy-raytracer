Done:

1. Basic CPU ray trace
2. Support Tinyobjloader to load obj file
3. BVH that support triangles, spheres, rect
4. Basic material, glass, metal and lambertian , normal map
5. Mesh light
6. Basic camera, with depth of field ,and motion blur
7. Multiple importance sampling, but not all the material


Todo:

1. Lens system, simulating a real camera including effect such as lens flare..
2. Build complete multiple importance sampling 
3. SAH
